# Elm Bonsai

Some reactive programming combinators inspired after elm language.

Computation model is slightly different from what elm employs. Elm signals react on events. Bonsai signals currently attempt to update on value changes, rather than value assignments. But this might change.

## Use

Ensure you have `python` and `pygame` installed. Run `main.py`. Then open that file and have a look.
